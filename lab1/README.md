### Reflective Analysis
This map was designed for the benefit of metal afficionados, that we might develop a better understanding of where the music is most commonly created and thus most likely to draw influenced from. It's admittedly more of a fun map but it does highlight some interesting trends. The most glaring observation is that playing in metal bands is very popular in Europe compared to the rest of the world, particularly in the Nordic countries. The love for this genre of music is so great in the Nordic countries that they require two outsized classes just for themselves (class breaks are listed on the legend). This is certainly no surprise for those are versed in the history of metal, as it was in these countries that the genre underwent transformational developments, as was the case in Britain and the USA. Furthermore, Mikael Akerfeldt of Sweden's Opeth and Vegard Tveitan of Norway's Emperor have been publicly credited their countries' social welfare systems as being a carte blanche for artists to pursue their passions without the crushing fear of financial hardship that may be common elsewhere. The second major observation is how metal is almost entirely the exclusive purview of countries whose national language is European in origin. Of course, correlation does not mean causation, but it lends credence to my hypothesis that a common language and cultural heritage between this nations has enabled a better transfusion of an otherwise niche and underground music genre. This is compounded by how countries in the lowest class are typically quite religious and/or have authoritatian governments, both of which may frown on the conent of metal as being opposed to 'traditional' social values. Because of how this skewed membership in the global metal scene, themes in metal tend to explore northern geographies as it is what the listenership is most familiar with. It will be interesting to see how themes, styles and lyrical content gradually shift as the fanbase of metal expands across the globe. 

I was not able to find geospatial data for this datatset, so I assemblbed it using population figures for the CIA World Factbook, # of Bands from Encyclopaedia Metallum, and a WGS84 Web Mercator [country boundary basemap](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/a21fdb46d23e4ef896f31475217cbb08_1) I found off of ESRI's website. Using the country names, I spatially joining the data in ArcGIS Pro and checked for countries that were classed differently (Taiwan wasn't independent in one of the lists!) then exported the vector as a geoJSON file into Mapbox Studio. This allowed me to bypass an annoying limitation with the Mapbox Dataset function, wherein it permits only CSVs with point data to be uploaded. Seeing as I did not have coordinates for each band, using vectors to form a choropleth map was the easiest way forward. It also was the type of map I intended to create anyway. I believe graduated coloured classes are the best format for this data on a world map where countries are sized differently and also share disparate demographics. One improvement I would make to this map is to have the areal units represent the total number of bands, with proprtional symbols atop each country representing the normalisation by population. Another way to do this would be an interactive mouseoever for each country that would then display the band density by population as a number ontop of the areal unit. A multivariate map would have been ideal at any rate, since the extra room afforded by the Web Mercator projection and zoom levels permits data to be added with clarity and a comparison of raw versus normalised data would go a long way on a projection distorting area and shape. 

Speaking of Mercator, I decided against adding a scale or north arrow, as the purpose of the map is clearly not for navigation and the two additional features would be distracting to boot. I also decided to set a mapview container of 1920x1080p pixels to take advantage of the desktop format's extra space and show more of the world for comparative purposes. In terms of colour scheme, I selected a range for countries spanned from light yellow to dark blue in order to avoid perceptual confusion that might occur in a monochromatic series of 7 classes. The classes themselves were determined by Natural Breaks (Jenks) in ArcGIS. (The default was 5 but I increased it to 7 after reviewing the distribution of values in the histogram) A dark red of reduced opacity was selected for bodies of water to provide a muted profile and contrast with the brighter yellow, green, blues of countries - it was also a neat thematic touch. Beneath my upload dataset, I underlaid an existing default tileset from Mapbox. This serves to fill in the blanks for countries with no data and it came with a country labels layer that I moved to the top of the drawing order. I gave the labels a halo to help them stand out from the map and adjusted their zoom settings so that the smaller countries would only have their labels pop up at a larger scale. I also widened their kerning so the words would appear less squished where many smaller countries were grouped. Because this is a thematic map, I deactivated the layers from the mapbox tileset that included terrain, traffic, etc, as they would be unnecessary visual noise. Finally, I set the colour of the state boundaries to a grey so that it would be distinguishable in both dark and light contexts. In addition to the map, I added a title in the top left and captioned it with my sources, setting both to white for contrast. I did the opposite with a medium grey background for my legend, and expanded the sizes of the colour patches for added ease of comparison. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to figure out how to shift the patch labels upwards so they remain slightly unaligned. Another regret of mine is that I wasn't able to properly set the minZoom: 2 without the entire map failing to draw. Right now, zooming all the way out to 0 forces all other layers except for the default tileset to disappear -  a feature of Mapbox Studio that can only be corrected through Mapbox GL code.
