## Reflective analysis: 

This map was made for a general audience with a cursory awareness of World War I. I have found in my experience that knowledge about this Great War is sorely lacking compared to World War 2. To me, this is a great tragedy as the consequences for World War I were arguably the main drivers for the collapse of European empires and the rise of extremist ideologies in their wake, thus setting the stage for World War II and further radical social reforms. To this end, I resolved to create a map to address in part this issue. The purpose of this map is to illustrate the futility and wanton loss of life over mere scraps of land that repeatedly changed hands for little purpose over the course of the war. Given how distant European geographies are to the typical Canadian high-schooler (the most likely point at which the average person learns about WW1 through formal education), the passing mentions of foreign personages and placenames in unfamiliar tongues quite possibly has the effect of flying in one ear and out the other for those not terribly interested in history. Certainly, it is easy to feel drowned amidst a deluge of such information and succumb to assuming platitudes without actual understanding. (e.g. that trench warfare was static and the war a big ol' family feud between royal heads of state) Thus, this map locates large, key battles of the war sorted by year and delivers concise facts about each. The close clustering of so many major battles then, serves to paint a clear profile of just how static the war was, in spite of the vast resources marshalled in its course.



Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your map be improved? 
Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
